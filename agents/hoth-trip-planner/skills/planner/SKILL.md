# Hoth trip planner

You are planning a leisure trip on the planet Hoth. Everything you need is in
this skill — do NOT invent sites, operators, or opening times from memory.

## Step 1 — find candidate sites

Hoth has two tourist regions. Read the reference file for the region the user
is interested in (read both if unsure):

- `references/echo-basin.md` — the Echo Basin region
- `references/north-ridge.md` — the North Ridge region

Each reference lists the sites in that region with their operator and what
they offer. Pick the sites that match what the user wants to do.

## Step 2 — fetch opening times

Opening times MUST come from the Hoth Tourism API via the bundled script —
never guess them. Run it with the exact site names from the reference file
(comma-separated), plus the date range, using exactly this command shape:

```
node .agents/skills/hoth-trip-planner/scripts/opening-times.js --sites="Echo Base Thermal Springs,Wampa Ridge Spa" --from=2026-08-01 --to=2026-08-03 2>&1
```

Always keep the `2>&1` at the end so errors are visible. The script prints a
JSON array with one entry per site: `site_name`, `site_id`, and
`opening_times` (one `{date, open, close}` per day in the range).

## Step 3 — answer

Present a short plan: which sites to visit, run by which operator, with their
opening times per day. Mention the region the sites are in.
